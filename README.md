# Secret Vote Parliament - FHE Governance Platform

A revolutionary decentralized governance platform that leverages **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** to ensure complete privacy in voting while maintaining transparency and verifiability. Built on the Sepolia testnet with RainbowKit wallet integration.

## üîê Key Features

- **FHE-Protected Voting**: All votes are encrypted using fully homomorphic encryption, ensuring complete privacy
- **Decentralized Governance**: Smart contract-based proposal creation and execution
- **Voter Registration**: Reputation-based voting power system
- **Real-time Results**: Encrypted vote counting with results revealed only after voting ends
- **Modern UI**: Built with React, TypeScript, and shadcn/ui components
- **Wallet Integration**: Seamless connection with RainbowKit and multiple wallet providers

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Smart Contract (`SecretVoteParliament.sol`)
- **FHE Integration**: Uses Zama's FHE library for encrypted operations
- **Voter Management**: Registration with reputation-based voting power
- **Proposal System**: Creation, voting, and execution of governance proposals
- **Privacy Protection**: All sensitive data encrypted using FHE

### Frontend Application
- **React + TypeScript**: Modern, type-safe development
- **RainbowKit**: Multi-wallet connection support
- **Wagmi**: Ethereum interaction library
- **Vite**: Fast development and build tooling

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- MetaMask or compatible wallet
- Sepolia testnet ETH for gas fees

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/cloudNetOps7/secret-vote-parliament.git
cd secret-vote-parliament

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
# Chain Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=11155111
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY

# Wallet Connect Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID

# Contract Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

## üìã Usage Guide

### 1. Connect Wallet
- Click "Connect Wallet" to link your MetaMask or other supported wallet
- Ensure you're connected to the Sepolia testnet

### 2. Register as Voter
- Click "Register as Voter" to join the governance system
- Your reputation will determine your voting power

### 3. Create Proposals
- Registered voters can create new governance proposals
- Set voting duration and execution delay
- Proposals require majority approval to execute

### 4. Cast Votes
- Vote on active proposals with complete privacy
- Your vote is encrypted using FHE and cannot be seen until voting ends
- Results are revealed automatically when voting period concludes

## üîß Development

### Available Scripts

```bash
# Development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Lint code
npm run lint
```

### Smart Contract Development

The smart contract is located in `contracts/SecretVoteParliament.sol` and uses:
- Solidity ^0.8.24
- Zama FHE library for encryption
- Sepolia testnet configuration

### Frontend Development

Built with modern React patterns:
- Custom hooks for contract interaction (`useContract.ts`)
- Type-safe wallet integration
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
